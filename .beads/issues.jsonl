Addresses all architectural decisions we'd do differently if starting over. This epic should be prioritized BEFORE continuing feature work.\n\n## 1. Real Data Pipeline First (replace procedural generation)\n- Run Python data pipeline (tools/heightmap, tools/provinces, tools/cities) to completion\n- Generate real heightmaps from SRTM data\n- Real province boundaries from AWMC shapefiles\n- Real city positions from Pleiades database\n- Generate 4096 binary chunks (4KB each) with real Mediterranean terrain\n- Load into Supabase from day one\n- Retire proceduralChunk.ts once real data is flowing\n\n## 2. BatchedMesh Instead of Per-Chunk Meshes\n- Replace individual THREE.Mesh per chunk with THREE.BatchedMesh\n- Group all LOD0 chunks into one BatchedMesh, LOD1 into another, etc.\n- Target: 4 draw calls total for terrain instead of 100-200\n- Handle geometry buffer limits and dynamic add/remove\n- Retrofit chunkLoader.ts to manage BatchedMesh instances\n\n## 3. Engine/World Scene Graph Manager\n- Extract monolithic main.ts (300 lines) into an Engine class\n- Subsystem registry pattern: each system implements init(), update(dt), dispose()\n- Main.ts becomes ~30 lines of bootstrap\n- Systems: terrain, water, provinces, cities, trees, agents, UI, input\n- Enables clean hot-reloading, testing, and adding new systems\n\n## 4. Remove Premature Quality Auto-Scaler\n- Strip qualityManager.ts (242 lines) with 4 presets and FPS-based auto-switching\n- Replace with one hardcoded quality setting\n- Re-add auto-scaler only when real performance bottlenecks are identified\n- Simplifies every system that currently has setQuality() methods\n\n## 5. IndexedDB Mesh Caching\n- Add idb-keyval mesh caching before further worker pool polish\n- Cache mesh geometry buffers keyed by (cx, cy, lod)\n- Instant terrain on page reload instead of full regeneration\n- Invalidation strategy for when chunk data changes\n\n## 6. ECS-Style Shared Data Architecture\n- Replace per-renderer data models (city, tree, province, water each with own model)\n- Shared world-state store or lightweight ECS\n- Single spatial index serving all systems\n- One data layer to connect when Supabase backend comes online\n- Eliminates 720-line cityDatabase.ts with hardcoded arrays\n\n## 7. Data Pipeline to Completion Before More Rendering\n- Complete all tools/ Python scripts (currently stubs)\n- Generate real binary chunks and validate renderer against real data\n- Ensures zero rework when switching from procedural to real data","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"ramonfueglister@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-17T17:48:21.241586672+01:00","created_by":"Ramon Fueglister","updated_at":"2026-02-17T20:40:41.710627419+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T20:40:41.710627419+01:00","close_reason":"All items verified implemented in codebase"}

{"id":"roma_aeterna-d1l0p","title":"BUG: Codex Batch 1 - TypeScript Errors \u0026 Test Failures","description":"Codex delivered unstaged changes across 12 files + 10 new files.\nThe code does NOT compile and has 5 test failures.\n\n## TypeScript Errors (2)\n\n### 1. logger.ts:28 - TS6138: unused private field 'category'\nLogger class declares `private readonly category` but never reads it (only passes category to createLogger in constructor).\nFix: remove the field or prefix with underscore.\n\n### 2. chunkCodec.test.ts:90 - TS2345: ArrayBufferLike vs ArrayBuffer\n`decodeChunkHeader(view.buffer)` - DataView.buffer returns ArrayBufferLike which includes SharedArrayBuffer. Our decodeChunkHeader expects ArrayBuffer.\nFix: cast `view.buffer as ArrayBuffer` or change function signature.\n\n## Test Failures (5)\n\n### 3. config.test.ts - 3 tests fail: validateAndLoadConfig returns valid=false for defaults\nRoot cause: `isPositiveIntLike()` is called on ALL NUMBER_FIELDS including nearClip (0.1) which is NOT an integer. The validator wrongly requires nearClip/farClip to be integers.\nFix: nearClip/farClip and frameBudgetMs should use isPositiveNumber, not isPositiveIntLike.\nAffected tests: 'loads default runtime config', 'validates geometry relationships', 'accepts valid overrides'.\n\n### 4. math.test.ts - tileToIndex clamping test wrong expectation\nTest expects tileToIndex(32, 31) === 31 but gets 1023.\ntileToIndex(32,31): x=32 clamped to 31, y=31 clamped to 31 → 31*32+31 = 1023.\nThe test expectation is wrong: it expected x=32 to clamp and y=31 to stay, giving index 31 (row 0 col 31). But y=31 is valid and stays 31.\nFix: correct the test expectation to 1023.\n\n### 5. supabase.test.ts - vi.mock hoisting error\nMock factory references `createClientMock` variable which is not yet initialized due to vi.mock hoisting.\nFix: use vi.hoisted() or move mock setup.\n\n## Design/Architecture Issues\n\n### 6. Unnecessary aliases bloating math.ts\nchunkToTile() is literally `return chunkToWorld()`. tileIndex() is literally `return tileToIndex()`. chunkDistance() is literally `return distance()`. Three pointless wrapper functions that add API surface with zero value.\n\n### 7. tileToIndex behavior silently changed\nOriginal tileToIndex was a pure math function (localY * CHUNK_SIZE + localX). Codex added clamping + Math.floor, changing the contract. Any caller passing already-validated values now pays unnecessary clamping overhead.\n\n### 8. Logger class wraps createLogger redundantly\nThe new Logger class just wraps the existing createLogger function factory. It adds a class for no reason - createLogger already returns the exact same debug/info/warn/error interface.\n\n### 9. main.ts imports non-existent getNetworkStatus at module level\nmain.ts references getNetworkStatus() which is defined later in the same file as a local function, but also imports from './startup' and './core/qualityManager'. These modules exist but the overall structure is fragile - startup.ts has an import from './supabase' which causes side effects at module load.\n\n### 10. startup.ts bad indentation\ncheckViewport() has broken indentation at line 61-67: the early return block is indented wrong (closing brace at column 0 inside a function body).\n\n### 11. supabase.ts references process.env in browser code\n`process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - process.env doesn't exist in browser. Vite only exposes import.meta.env. This will throw ReferenceError at runtime.\n\n### 12. chunkCodec.ts - unnecessary API surface\nExposed CHUNK_MAGIC, CHUNK_VERSION, CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE as exports + new decodeChunkHeader/encodeChunkHeader functions. These are internal implementation details that should stay private.
